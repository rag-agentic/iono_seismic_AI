Even though the ionosphere only contains a small fraction of atmospheric material, it is very important because of its influence on the passage of radio waves. 
Most of the ionosphere is electrically neutral, but when solar radiation strikes the chemical constituents of the atmosphere electrons are dislodged from atoms and molecules to produce the ionospheric plasma. This occurs on the sunlit side of the Earth, and only the shorter wavelengths of solar radiation, (the extreme ultraviolet and X-ray part of the spectrum), are energetic enough to produce this ionization. The presence of these charged particles makes the upper atmosphere an electrical conductor, which supports electric currents and affects radio waves.
At high latitudes there is another source of ionization called the aurora. The aurora is a display of lights caused by electrons and protons striking the atmosphere at high speed. The particles come from the magnetosphere and spiral down the magnetic field lines of the Earth. These particles produce a spectacular array of light, and when they strike the atmosphere they also produce ionization. The auroral oval is named be cause of its shape, and exists in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres above about 60 degrees geomagnetic latitude (see “Aurora”, Space Environment Topics SE–12).
At low latitudes the largest electron densities are found in peaks on either side of the magnetic equator; this is a feature known as the equatorial anomaly. The peak ionospheric concentrations do not occur on the equator, as might be expected from the maximum in solar ionizing radiation, but instead are displaced on either side. This peculiarity is due to the geometry of the magnetic field and the presence of electric fields. The electric fields that transport the plasma are caused by a polarizing effect of the thermospheric winds.
