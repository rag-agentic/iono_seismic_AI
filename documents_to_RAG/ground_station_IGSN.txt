IGSN ground stations continuously collect high-precision GPS data, which is used for:

    Monitoring tectonic plate movements and crustal deformation
    Studying atmospheric conditions, including water vapor content
    Providing reference data for precise positioning applications
    Atmospheric and ionospheric studies,
   
    Here, the list of ground stations that you can use for have positions for analyse STEC 
    A STEC (Slant Total Electron Content) greater than 0.1 (in TECU units, which is 10^16 electrons/m²) 
    is often considered to indicate significant disturbances in the ionosphere. 

    When you read a STEC value from a file, you refer to the GPS ground station to determine the geographical region of the ionospheric disturbance.
